This utility can take a cor plot .mat file and turn it into a python data object.  The goal is to present the data from a cor plot in a meaningful way.This utility has a couple of test files that are used for testing, but we can use them for examples.  All examples are run from this directory.  Current example is using Python2.7

Example: 'test_scan.mat'

Import and Initialize cor plot data object
 ```
>>> from cor_plot_mat_scan import CorPlotMatScan as CPMS
>>> cpms = CPMS('test_scan.mat')
```

Access Properties.  Here are some of the properties that are defined for the data object.
```
>>> cpms.fields
('accelerator', 'status', 'ctrlPV', 'beam', 'profPV', 'ts', 'config')
>>> cpms.accelerator
'LCLS2'
>>> cpms.ctrl_pv
'SOLN:GUNB:212:BCTRL'
>>> cpms.iterations
10
>>> cpms.ctrl_vals
[0.072999999999999995, 0.073888888888888879, 0.074777777777777776, 0.07566666666666666, 0.076555555555555557, 0.077444444444444441, 0.078333333333333338, 0.079222222222222222, 0.080111111111111119, 0.081000000000000003]
>>> cpms.beam_names
('profx', 'xStat', 'xStatStd', 'profy', 'yStat', 'yStatStd', 'profu', 'uStat', 'uStatStd', 'method', 'stats', 'statsStd')
>>> cpms.timestamp
737730.05017097027
>>> cpms.samples
2
```

Access Beam Data.  This is very tricky and could use some cleanup.  This is all the metadata associated with the scan and goes by the nature of cpms.beam[iteration][sample][fit].  The fits are in the following order FIT = ['Gaussian', 'Asymmetric', 'Super', 'RMS', 'RMS cut peak', 'RMS cut area', 'RMS floor'].

Example, say I want to get a specific field from beam_names.  Say 'profx' for iteration 3, sample 2 and 'RMS cut peak' (5, index of 4):
```
>>> cpms.beam[2][1][4]['profx']
array([[ -8.04000000e+03,  -8.02392000e+03,  -8.00784000e+03, ...,
          5.37072000e+03,   5.38680000e+03,   5.40288000e+03],
       [  0.00000000e+00,   0.00000000e+00,   2.49000000e+02, ...,
          1.72000000e+02,   0.00000000e+00,   2.64000000e+02],
       [  1.72791308e+01,   1.77236486e+01,   1.81784282e+01, ...,
          4.98085984e+00,   4.84116133e+00,   4.70507716e+00]])
```

As you can see, this whole beam property needs a lot of cleanup.  I do not even know what profx is, maybe an x projection/histogram of the profile monitor?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Good luck!
